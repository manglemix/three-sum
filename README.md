# Three Sums

My basic solution to the three sums problem that my friends introduced to me from LeetCode.  
It utilizes non-comparison based sorting and a simplified HashSet,  
and boasts a best case performance of O(n) and an average/worst case of O(N^2).

While it is not a requirement in the problem, my solution is quite parallelizable.
