# Three Sums

My basic solution to the three sums problem that my friends introduced to me from LeetCode.  
It utilizes non-comparison based sorting and binary search, while avoiding HashMaps and Sets,  
and boasts a best case performance of O(n) and a *probably* average case of O(N^2 log n).

While it is not a requirement in the problem, my solution is quite parallelizable.
